🎮 Using the Application
Step 1: Data Input
Click "📤 Data Input" tab
Choose one of two options:
Upload File: Click the upload area and select your file
Manual Entry: Type or paste transactions directly
Load Sample: Click "Load Sample" for demo data
Click "Process Transactions"
Step 2: Configure Parameters
Click "⚙️ Configure" tab
Set Minimum Support Count: How many transactions must contain an itemset
Example: 2 means item must appear in at least 2 transactions
Set Minimum Confidence: How reliable a rule must be (0.0 - 1.0)
Example: 0.5 means 50% confidence threshold
Click "🚀 Run Analysis"
Step 3: View Results
Automatically switches to "📊 Results" tab
See four key metrics:
Total Transactions
Frequent Items Found
Frequent Pairs Found
Association Rules Generated
Browse association rules sorted by Lift
📊 Understanding the Metrics
Support
Formula: count(A ∩ B) / total_transactions

Example: Support = 0.20 (20%)

Means 20% of all transactions contain this itemset
Interpretation: Higher support = more common pattern

Confidence
Formula: count(A ∩ B) / count(A)

Example: Confidence({Bread} → {Butter}) = 0.75 (75%)

When customers buy Bread, 75% also buy Butter
Interpretation: Higher confidence = stronger rule

Lift
Formula: Confidence(A→B) / P(B)

Example: Lift = 1.5

Customers are 1.5x more likely to buy B when buying A
Interpretation:

Lift > 1: Positive correlation (buy together)
Lift = 1: No correlation (independent)
Lift < 1: Negative correlation (don't buy together)

Interaction Design
Smooth fade-in animations on page load
Staggered reveals for results
Hover states with subtle transforms
Tab transitions with custom indicators
🔧 Customization
Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in :root:

:root {
    --primary: #1a472a;      /* Main brand color */
    --accent: #d4af37;        /* Highlight color */
    --bg-main: #faf8f3;       /* Page background */
}
Adjusting Animations
Modify animation timing:

@keyframes fadeInUp {
    from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
Default Parameters
Change initial values in the React component:

const [minSupport, setMinSupport] = useState(2);      // Default: 2
const [minConfidence, setMinConfidence] = useState(0.5); // Default: 50%
📱 Browser Compatibility

🔍 Algorithm Details
Implementation Steps
Pass 1: Find Frequent Items

Count occurrence of each item
Filter items with count >= minSupport
Pass 2: Generate Frequent Pairs

Create all possible pairs from frequent items
Count occurrence of each pair
Filter pairs with count >= minSupport
Pass 3: Generate Association Rules

For each frequent pair {A, B}:
Create rule A → B
Calculate support, confidence, lift
Keep if confidence >= minConfidence
Sort rules by lift (descending)
Complexity
Time: O(n × m²) where n = transactions, m = unique items
Space: O(m²) for storing pairs
Scalability: Suitable for datasets up to ~10,000 transactions in browser
🚀 Performance Tips
For Large Datasets (1000+ transactions)
Increase minimum support to reduce candidates
Set higher confidence threshold
Use modern browser (Chrome recommended)
Close unnecessary tabs to free memory
For Better Results
Start with lower thresholds to see patterns
Gradually increase to find strongest rules
Look for high lift values (1.5+)
Consider support context (very high support may be obvious)

🆘 Troubleshooting
"No valid transactions found"
Check data format matches examples
Ensure items separated by commas
Remove empty lines
"No association rules found"
Lower minimum support (try 1 or 2)
Reduce minimum confidence (try 0.3)
Verify dataset has repeated items
Slow Performance
Reduce dataset size for testing
Increase minimum support
